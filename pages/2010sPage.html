          <h4>Web Servers and Dynamic Web Applications</h4>
          <p>
            The 2010s witnessed a significant evolution in web applications, marked by the
            proliferation of responsive design, the rise of single-page applications (SPAs), and the
            emergence of powerful front-end frameworks. The focus shifted towards creating seamless,
            user-friendly experiences across devices and platforms. Responsive design became a
            standard practice, allowing websites to adapt fluidly to different screen sizes. SPAs
            gained popularity, enabling faster and more interactive applications by loading content
            dynamically without full page reloads. Front-end frameworks like Angular, React, and
            Vue.js revolutionized web development, providing robust tools for building complex and
            scalable applications. Additionally, the widespread adoption of APIs and the growth of
            cloud computing facilitated seamless integration with third-party services and the
            development of cloud-based applications. The 2010s marked a turning point in web
            application development, paving the way for more dynamic, engaging, and user-centric
            experiences on the web.
          </p>
          <h4>Open Source Repositories</h4>
          <p>
            Open source repositories like GitHub have played a pivotal role in shaping the modern
            landscape of software development and collaboration. During the 2010s and beyond, GitHub
            emerged as the go-to platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on open source
            projects. It provided developers with a centralized and accessible hub to contribute to
            projects, explore codebases, and collaborate with a global community of developers. In
            fact this page is hosted on Github
          </p>
          <h4>JavaScript Frameworks</h4>
          <p>
            And of course, I think the #1 biggest development regarding web in the 2010s and what
            seperates modern web development from the 2000s is the massive shift from programmers to
            use JS frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript framework is a pre-written collection of code and libraries that provides
            developers with a structured way to build web applications. It offers a set of tools,
            functions, and components that streamline the development process and help developers
            solve common challenges in web application development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary purpose of a JavaScript framework is to simplify and accelerate the
            development of complex web applications. It provides a foundation that includes
            essential features and functionalities, allowing developers to focus more on the
            application logic and less on writing repetitive or boilerplate code.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript frameworks typically offer features such as data binding, DOM manipulation,
            routing, form validation, and more. They provide a structured architecture or design
            pattern to organize the codebase, making it easier to manage and maintain as the
            application grows.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key advantages of using a JavaScript framework is the ability to build
            interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Frameworks often provide a component-based
            approach, allowing developers to create reusable UI components that can be easily
            composed and updated based on user interactions or data changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, JavaScript frameworks promote code reusability, modularity, and separation
            of concerns, which leads to more maintainable and scalable codebases. They also offer
            robust community support, extensive documentation, and a wide range of third-party
            libraries and plugins that further enhance the development experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, JavaScript frameworks aim to simplify and standardize the process of web
            application development, improve developer productivity, and enable the creation of
            robust and feature-rich applications.

            In conclusion, the evolution of the web from the 1990s to the 2020s has been nothing
            short of remarkable. From its humble beginnings as a simple collection of static
            websites with basic HTML and limited interactivity, the web has transformed into a
            dynamic and interactive platform that powers countless applications and connects people
            across the globe. During the 1990s, the web experienced rapid growth and the birth of
            essential technologies like HTTP, HTML, and hyperlinks. The introduction of web browsers
            and search engines made it easier to navigate and discover content. The 2000s saw the
            rise of social media, blogs, and interactive web applications, paving the way for
            user-generated content and online communities. The 2010s witnessed the emergence of
            JavaScript frameworks and libraries, revolutionizing frontend development and enabling
            the creation of highly interactive and responsive web experiences. The focus shifted
            towards mobile-first design and responsive layouts as the use of smartphones and tablets
            became widespread. In the 2020s, the web continues to evolve with advancements in
            technologies like Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), WebAssembly, and serverless architecture.
            Accessibility, performance optimization, and security have become major considerations
            in web development. Overall, the web has evolved from a static information-sharing
            platform to a dynamic ecosystem of interconnected applications, offering rich multimedia
            experiences, real-time communication, and personalized content.
