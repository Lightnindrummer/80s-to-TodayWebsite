        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
          During the 2000s, the web underwent a transformative phase, experiencing a mix of
          innovative designs and technological developments. Websites were characterized by vibrant

          with the rise of video streaming platforms like YouTube and the revolution of online music
          platforms. Web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and AJAX enabled dynamic and
          interactive web experiences. Towards the end of the decade, mobile internet started to
          gain traction with the emergence of smartphones, paving the way for mobile-friendly

        <h2>State of Web Development</h2>
        <h3>The Big Three: HTML, CSS, JS</h3>
        <p>
          Together, JavaScript (JS), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Hypertext Markup Language
          (HTML) formed the core technologies for building websites in the 2000s. They provided the
          necessary tools and capabilities for creating interactive, visually appealing, and
          well-structured web pages. HTML would provide the base structure of the website, with CSS
          providing the styling and look of the website, and JavaScript would provide the
          interactivity. Here's an overview of their characteristrics and relevance during the
          2000s:

        <div class="programmingLangContent" id="htmlContent">
          <p>
            <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):</strong> HTML continued to be the foundation
            of web development. During the 2000s, HTML saw advancements with the release of HTML4
            and its associated specifications. HTML4 introduced new elements and attributes,
            enabling better structuring of web pages. It supported multimedia embedding through the
            &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, making it possible to include audio and video
            content directly in web pages.

            <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</strong> CSS evolved in the 2000s, enabling web
            designers to control the visual presentation of web pages. CSS allowed for precise
            control over layout, typography, colors, and effects. With CSS, developers could
            separate the structure and content of a website from its visual styling, making it
            easier to maintain and update.

            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript became an integral part of web development
            during the 2000s. It allowed developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to
            websites. JavaScript frameworks like jQuery gained popularity, simplifying DOM
            manipulation and providing handy features for animations, event handling, and AJAX
            requests. JavaScript also played a role in client-side form validation, enhancing user
            experience and data integrity. ES5 would be the latest JavaScript Version released in
            the 2000s.

        <h4>Beginning of responsive design</h4>
        <p>
          Responsive design emerged as a concept in the 2000s to address the increasing diversity of
          devices accessing the web. With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, designers
          and developers faced the challenge of creating websites that could adapt to different
          screen sizes and resolutions. To tackle the challenge of responsive design in the 2000s,
          designers and developers adopted several techniques and best practices. Here are some key
          approaches they employed:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fluid Grids: Designers used relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixel
            values to create flexible and fluid grid systems. This allowed elements on the page to
            resize and adapt to different screen sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexible Images: Images were scaled using CSS properties like max-width: 100% to ensure
            they didn't overflow or break the layout on smaller screens. This prevented images from
            being too large or cropped on mobile devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media Queries: Developers utilized CSS media queries to apply different styles and
            layout rules based on the characteristics of the device or screen size. This included
            adjusting font sizes, hiding or repositioning elements, and modifying the overall layout
            structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobile-first Approach: Designers often adopted a mobile-first approach, starting with
            the smallest screen sizes and gradually enhancing the design for larger screens. This
            ensured a solid foundation for mobile devices and prevented the need for extensive
            modifications later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testing and Iteration: Designers and developers conducted thorough testing on various
            devices and screen sizes to ensure the responsiveness of their designs. They made
            adjustments and iterated based on user feedback and evolving technologies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Rise of frontend libraries and frameworks</h4>
        <p>
          Writing code in base JavaScript or CSS in tandem with HTML would sometimes prove to be a
          headache for developers as more complex applications and websites were made. As a result,
          the web development landscape saw the rise of several frontend libraries and frameworks
          that greatly reduced the work developers had to put in to build interactive and dynamic
          websites. Here are some notable examples:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            jQuery: Introduced in 2006, jQuery simplified DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX
            interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            SASS/SCSS: CSS preprocessors that introduced advanced features like variables, mixins,
            and nesting.
          </li>
          <li>
            AJAX: Enabled asynchronous data retrieval from servers without page refresh, enhancing
            interactivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prototype.js: Provided tools for DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, and reusable UI
            components.
          </li>
          <li>
            MooTools: Emphasized object-oriented programming principles and offered features for DOM
            manipulation and animation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In conclusion, the 2000s played a crucial role in shaping the web into a more dynamic,
          interconnected, and user-centric platform. It was characterized by significant
          advancements in technology, the rise of social media and blogging platforms, and the
          evolution of web development practices; a time of experimentation and innovation as
          designers and developers explored new possibilities and pushed the boundaries of what the
          web could offer. It ultimately set the stage for the rapid advancements and transformative
          experiences that would come in the following decades.
