      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        During the 1990s, the World Wide Web underwent a transformative period of growth and
        development. It was a time when the internet was transitioning from a niche technology used
        primarily by academics and researchers to a global phenomenon that would revolutionize
        communication, commerce, and information sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web during the 90s was characterized by its simplicity, limited technology, and a sense
        of exploration and experimentation. Websites were predominantly text-based, graphics were
        minimal, and interactivity was limited. This era laid the foundation for many of the
        technologies and concepts that shape the modern web today. Let's dive deeper into the
        various aspects of the web during the 1990s and explore how it has evolved over time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 30px; padding: 10px 70px" id="generalWebInfo">
      <h2>What the Web Was Like</h2>
      <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Imagine the internet without all the advertisements, complex websites and their layouts,
        social media platforms, web apps, games, the presense of big tech companies like Google and
        Amazon, mobile design, and even funny memes.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the internet of the '90s. It was slow, sometimes frustrating, and unsophisticated.
        You couldn't access through your phone because phones couldn't do that. You had to use a big
        clunky desktop computer that if it ran any of the apps modern computers come installed with,
        it would probably crash. Yet it was simple and excitement inducing. People at the time
        wondered and discovered the vast possibilities of such a frontier.
      </p>
      <h4 id="creation">Creation</h4>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web, often referred to simply as the web, was created during the 1990s by a
        British computer scientist named Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee's vision was to develop a
        system that would allow researchers to easily share and access information across different
        computers and networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1989, while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in
        Switzerland, Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for what would become the World Wide Web. His
        proposal outlined the concept of hypertext, a way of linking documents together using
        hyperlinks, and described the development of a system that would enable people to navigate
        and retrieve information stored on remote computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Berners-Lee's system consisted of three key components: HTML, HTTP, and a Web Browser, all
        topics covered later in this page. With these foundational elements in place, Berners-Lee
        and his team at CERN worked on implementing and refining the web protocols and tools. They
        gradually expanded the web's capabilities, enabling features such as images, forms, and the
        ability to display different media types.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1993, CERN made the World Wide Web technology freely available to the public, marking the
        beginning of its widespread adoption. This openness and accessibility played a crucial role
        in the rapid growth of the web during the 1990s, as developers worldwide embraced the
        technology and began creating their own websites and web applications.
      </p>
      <h4 id="whatOnIt">What Was Even On It?</h4>
      <p>
        Since the internet was during it's early stages of development there was not exactly much
        going on, but I can give you a list with some amount of explaination.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Basic Websites: The World Wide Web was emerging as a popular way to access and share
          information. They were were often simple and focused on providing information rather than
          complex interactive experiences as they were primarily composed of static web pages
          written and formatted in HTML, containing text and images.
        </li>
        <li>
          Email, Online Chat and Messaging: Email was widely used as a primary means of electronic
          communication. However, the email clients and interfaces were relatively basic compared to
          modern email services. Messenger platforms, which allowed users to instantly chat with
          each other would also become prevalent in the internet during the '90s.
        </li>
        <li>
          Forums and Bulletin Boards: Online forums and bulletin board systems (BBS) were popular
          for discussion and information sharing. Users could participate in discussions on various
          topics, post messages, and interact with others who shared similar interests. These paved
          the way for online blogs and social media platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          E-commerce: E-commerce began to emerge in the 90s, with websites like Amazon and eBay
          paving the way for online shopping. However, online transactions were not as prevalent or
          secure as they are today.
        </li>
        <li>
          File-sharing: File sharing during the 90s was primarily done through FTP (File Transfer
          Protocol) and Usenet groups. Users could upload and download files from remote servers or
          participate in newsgroups to share files and engage in discussions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 id="searchEnginesAndBrowsers">Creation of Search Engines and Browsers</h4>
      <p>
        During the '90s the first search engines and web browsers would be developed and released
        for the public to use. If you don't know a search engine is a program that provided users
        with a way to search for specific content, websites, or resources based on keywords. A web
        browser is used the gateway for accessing and navigating the World Wide Web. They provide
        users a way to view web pages, follow hyperlinks, and interact with online content.
      </p>
      <p>Some popular web browsers during the time included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mosaic: Developed in 1993, Mosaic is considered one of the first widely-used web browsers.
          It introduced features like inline images and a user-friendly interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Netscape Navigator: Released in 1994, Netscape Navigator became immensely popular and
          played a significant role in popularizing the web. It offered features like support for
          plugins, frames, and JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internet Explorer: Developed by Microsoft, Internet Explorer was released in 1995 as a
          competitor to Netscape Navigator. It quickly gained market share and became the dominant
          browser during the late 90s.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some popular search engines during the time included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          AltaVista: Founded in 1995, AltaVista was one of the early popular search engines. It
          offered advanced search features, including image and multimedia search capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Yahoo!: Initially launched as a web directory, Yahoo! introduced its search engine in
          1994. It played a significant role in organizing and categorizing the growing web content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excite: Excite was another prominent search engine during the 90s, offering a
          user-friendly interface and a range of search options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lycos: Lycos, established in 1994, was known for its comprehensive search results and a
          focus on web crawling and indexing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As slow, imperfect, and inefficient these elements of the internet were, as said before,
        they would set up their modern day equivalents to be what they are today.
      </p>
      <h4 id="effectsOnSociety">Effects on Society</h4>
      <p>

      <h4>HTML</h4>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" crossorigin="anonymous">Resource to learn this</a>
      <p>
        HTML(HyperText Markup Language) was created to be the backup of the internet. While
        technically a markup language, many programmers consider it as the backbone of all websites.
        The language is unmistakable for it's syntax that mostly uses opening and closing tags to
        represent elements of a website. No matter what decade they were created in, all websites
        use some sort of HTML. During the 1990s, versions 1.0 to 3.2 of HTML would be developed and
        released to the public.

      <h4>HTTP and Hyperlinks</h4>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">Learn HTTP</a>
      <p>
        HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that governs the communication between web
        servers and clients, enabling the transfer of hypertext documents on the internet. It is the
        foundation of the World Wide Web and plays a crucial role in how information is requested,
        transmitted, and displayed on web browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the 90s, HTTP was an essential part of the internet infrastructure, facilitating the
        delivery of web content. It allowed users to access websites by requesting specific
        resources, such as HTML files, images, or videos, from web servers. HTTP defined a set of
        rules for how these requests and responses should be formatted and transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hyperlinks, also known as links, are the clickable elements on web pages that connect one
        resource to another. They allow users to navigate between different web pages, websites, or
        sections within a page. Hyperlinks were a fundamental feature of the World Wide Web in the
        90s, enabling users to explore and discover content across the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 90s, hyperlinks were primarily text-based, typically displayed in a different color
        or underlined to indicate their clickable nature. When a user clicked on a hyperlink, their
        web browser would send an HTTP request to the linked URL, and the corresponding web page or
        resource would be loaded and displayed in the browser window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both HTTP and hyperlinks were instrumental in shaping the relevance and usability of the
        internet during the 90s. They allowed for seamless navigation between web pages,
        facilitating the interconnected nature of the web. This made it easier for users to access
        and share information, fostering the growth of online communities, the dissemination of
        knowledge, and the expansion of online services and businesses.

      <h4>PHP</h4>
      <p>
        PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that was highly relevant to
        the development of the internet during the 90s. It was specifically designed for web
        development and played a significant role in powering dynamic websites and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the 90s, the web was transitioning from static HTML pages to more interactive and
        dynamic content. PHP emerged as a popular scripting language that allowed developers to
        embed server-side code directly into web pages. This enabled the generation of dynamic
        content based on user input, database queries, and other server-side processes.

        PHP provided a range of features and functionalities that were instrumental in the
        development of interactive websites during the 90s. It offered seamless integration with
        databases, allowing developers to retrieve and manipulate data dynamically. PHP also
        supported server-side form handling, session management, and the ability to create and
        manage cookies, enhancing the interactivity and personalization of websites.

        Additionally, PHP had extensive support for server-side file manipulation, enabling
        developers to upload and process files, manage directories, and perform various file-related
        operations. This was particularly relevant for websites that involved user-generated
        content, such as forums, file-sharing platforms, and early social networking sites.

        The simplicity and flexibility of PHP made it widely adopted by web developers during the
        90s. It provided a server-side scripting solution that was easy to learn and allowed for
        rapid web development. PHP's open-source nature also contributed to its popularity, as it
        fostered a vibrant community of developers who created libraries, frameworks, and resources
        to further enhance PHP's capabilities.

        Overall, PHP played a crucial role in the evolution of the internet during the 90s by
        enabling the development of dynamic and interactive websites. It provided the necessary
        tools and functionality for developers to create engaging online experiences, paving the way
        for the modern web we know today.
